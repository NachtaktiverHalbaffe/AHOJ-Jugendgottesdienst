# AHOJ-Jugendgottesdienst
This was my first bigger programming project during my IT classes in school. I worked afterwards on this app to use it for an voluntary project at the [Evangelisches Jugendwerk Bezirk Esslingen](https://www.eje-esslingen.de/) and it was published some years in the Google Playstore until the project itself shutdown and the app was removed.

With this app my programming journey started, so don't expect too much quality in the code.
